Migrating from TFS (Team Foundation Server) 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022 is not a straightforward jump. This usually involves a sequence of upgrades, as it's often recommended to move through certain versions sequentially to ensure that the migration is smooth.

Here is a broad overview of the steps involved:

1. **Environment Preparation**:
    - Backup TFS databases.
    - Install and configure a SQL Server version supported by both TFS 2015 and Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Setup a temporary TFS 2018 upgrade environment if needed, as direct migration from TFS 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022 might not be supported.

2. **Upgrade to TFS 2017 or TFS 2018**:
    - Download TFS 2017 or TFS 2018.
    - Install TFS 2017 or 2018 on a separate machine or a different environment. (Avoid upgrading your live server until you are sure the migration works.)
    - Detach collections from TFS 2015, backup the databases, and then attach them to the TFS 2017/2018 environment.
    - Upgrade the databases in the TFS 2017/2018 environment.
    - Validate the upgrade. Ensure that data, builds, source code, work items, etc., are all intact.

3. **Upgrade to Azure DevOps Server 2019**:
    - As above, start by installing Azure DevOps Server 2019 in a separate environment.
    - Detach collections from TFS 2017/2018, backup databases, and then attach to Azure DevOps Server 2019.
    - Upgrade the databases.
    - Validate the upgrade.

4. **Upgrade to Azure DevOps Server 2022**:
    - Install Azure DevOps Server 2022 in a separate environment.
    - Detach collections from Azure DevOps Server 2019, backup databases, and then attach to Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Upgrade the databases.
    - Validate the upgrade.

5. **Post-migration Steps**:
    - If extensions or customizations were present in TFS 2015, ensure compatible versions are available for Azure DevOps Server 2022 and install/configure them.
    - Update build agents and any build or release definitions.
    - Notify users to update their Visual Studio and other tools to versions that are compatible with Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Validate integrations with other systems if there are any.

6. **Backup & Rollback Plan**:
    - Always maintain backups of databases at each stage. If something goes wrong, you should be able to rollback.
    - Test rollback scenarios in a separate environment.

7. **Final Thoughts**:
    - It's always beneficial to read the release notes and migration guides for each version you're migrating through.
    - Test each upgrade step in a non-production environment to ensure there's a minimal impact when you upgrade the live server.
    - Depending on the size and complexity of your projects, the upgrade process can be time-consuming and complex. It's advisable to get the involvement of individuals with experience in Azure DevOps migrations.

Lastly, always refer to Microsoft's official documentation when planning and executing migrations, as they offer the most detailed and up-to-date guidance.
