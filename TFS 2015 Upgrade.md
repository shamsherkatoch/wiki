# TFS 2015 Upgrade
Migrating from TFS (Team Foundation Server) 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022 is not a straightforward jump. This usually involves a sequence of upgrades, as it's often recommended to move through certain versions sequentially to ensure that the migration is smooth.

Here is a broad overview of the steps involved:

1. **Environment Preparation**:
    - Backup TFS databases.
    - Install and configure a SQL Server version supported by both TFS 2015 and Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Setup a temporary TFS 2018 upgrade environment if needed, as direct migration from TFS 2015 to Azure DevOps Server 2022 might not be supported.

2. **Upgrade to TFS 2017 or TFS 2018**:
    - Download TFS 2017 or TFS 2018.
    - Install TFS 2017 or 2018 on a separate machine or a different environment. (Avoid upgrading your live server until you are sure the migration works.)
    - Detach collections from TFS 2015, backup the databases, and then attach them to the TFS 2017/2018 environment.
    - Upgrade the databases in the TFS 2017/2018 environment.
    - Validate the upgrade. Ensure that data, builds, source code, work items, etc., are all intact.

3. **Upgrade to Azure DevOps Server 2019**:
    - As above, start by installing Azure DevOps Server 2019 in a separate environment.
    - Detach collections from TFS 2017/2018, backup databases, and then attach to Azure DevOps Server 2019.
    - Upgrade the databases.
    - Validate the upgrade.

4. **Upgrade to Azure DevOps Server 2022**:
    - Install Azure DevOps Server 2022 in a separate environment.
    - Detach collections from Azure DevOps Server 2019, backup databases, and then attach to Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Upgrade the databases.
    - Validate the upgrade.

5. **Post-migration Steps**:
    - If extensions or customizations were present in TFS 2015, ensure compatible versions are available for Azure DevOps Server 2022 and install/configure them.
    - Update build agents and any build or release definitions.
    - Notify users to update their Visual Studio and other tools to versions that are compatible with Azure DevOps Server 2022.
    - Validate integrations with other systems if there are any.

6. **Backup & Rollback Plan**:
    - Always maintain backups of databases at each stage. If something goes wrong, you should be able to rollback.
    - Test rollback scenarios in a separate environment.

7. **Final Thoughts**:
    - It's always beneficial to read the release notes and migration guides for each version you're migrating through.
    - Test each upgrade step in a non-production environment to ensure there's a minimal impact when you upgrade the live server.
    - Depending on the size and complexity of your projects, the upgrade process can be time-consuming and complex. It's advisable to get the involvement of individuals with experience in Azure DevOps migrations.

Refer to Microsoft's official documentation when planning and executing migrations, as they offer the most detailed and up-to-date guidance.

# TFS 2018 Installation
Installing TFS (Team Foundation Server) 2018 involves multiple steps, including preparing the environment, executing the installation, and post-installation configurations. Here's a broad outline to guide you through the installation process:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   
   - **Hardware**: Ensure that your server meets the minimum hardware requirements. The specifics vary depending on your expected load, but for a basic installation, at least 2 cores and 8 GB of RAM should be available.
   
   - **Operating System**: TFS 2018 supports Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, and a few other OS versions. Ensure you have the latest patches and updates installed.
   
   - **SQL Server**: TFS requires SQL Server for its data storage. Supported versions for TFS 2018 include SQL Server 2017, 2016, and 2014. Also, consider installing SQL Server Analysis Services and SQL Server Reporting Services if you'll be using TFS's reporting features.
   
   - **.NET Framework**: Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.6 or later installed.
   
   - **Client Software**: Install a supported version of Visual Studio or Team Explorer if you plan to connect to TFS from the same machine.

2. **Download and Install TFS**:
   
   - Obtain the TFS 2018 installation media. You can download it from the Microsoft website.
   
   - Run the installer, and on the welcome screen, choose the "Install Team Foundation Server" option.
   
   - Follow the prompts. The installer will check for prerequisites and guide you if anything is missing.

3. **Configuration**:
   
   - After installation, the TFS Configuration Center will launch.
   
   - If this is your first time setting up TFS, you'll likely want to use the "Standard Single Server" or "Advanced" configurations.
     
     - **Standard Single Server**: Ideal for simpler setups where everything (TFS, SQL Server, Reporting) is on one machine.
     
     - **Advanced**: Provides more granular control, ideal for larger setups or when you have separated concerns (like SQL Server on a different machine).
   
   - Follow the prompts:
     
     - Specify the SQL Server instance.
     
     - Configure the service account for TFS. A dedicated account is preferable.
     
     - Configure the website settings for TFS. Default values are typically fine unless you have specific requirements.
     
     - If you installed Reporting Services and Analysis Services, configure the reporting for TFS.
     
     - Review the settings, and initiate the configuration.

4. **Post-installation**:
   
   - Once the configuration is complete, you can access the TFS web portal using the URL you configured earlier.
   
   - Connect to TFS using Visual Studio or Team Explorer to create your team projects.
   
   - Install any necessary extensions or integrations as required by your team.
   
   - Set up security and permissions. Ensure you grant access only to necessary personnel.

5. **Backup and Maintenance**:

   - Plan a backup strategy. Regular backups of the TFS databases are crucial.
   
   - Monitor the server performance, especially if you have a large team or heavy usage.

Refer to the official Microsoft documentation for the most detailed and updated instructions when installing TFS. The above guide provides a general overview, but specifics can change based on updates, patches, or specific business needs.
